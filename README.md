Contained within the repository are two scripts:

1. script.cpp: This script implements the RRT path planning algorithm.
2. plot.py: This Python script is responsible for visualizing the path using matplotlib animation. The obstacle and path data need to be incorporated into this script.
   
To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/sakshi1313/RRT_path_planning.git
2. Run the script.cpp: Compile and run the script.cpp file.
3. View the output: The generated path coordinates will be displayed in the terminal.
